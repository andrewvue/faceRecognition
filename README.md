# faceRecognition
A fullstack facial recognition application built using React

Using ReactJS as the main tool to create an app that allows the user to log in and use the app that connects to an API that can detect faces in a photo.

Through this project I learned how to create a database and connect my front end to a back end. This lets me be more aware of how I should set up my front end design and code so that it will be easier to integrate the front end and back end.

Learning to use ReactJS in this while building this application allowed me to not worry too much about DOM manipulation and can focus on the main objective of getting my application to funciton properly.
